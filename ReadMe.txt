Hey Folks,

This is mostly a project I have set up to give a demo of different features in Selenium.
This project would need Eclipse, Selenium-Server-Standalone-2.2.5.0.jar

Application Under Test: https://www.kanbanpad.com/
This is a project Management web site and offers features to track your project progress day to day.

I have used Page Factory with in to base my tests.


Thanks,
Nishant
